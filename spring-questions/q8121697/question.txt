I'm using Spring.NET and running into problematically long Ioc Container load times. 
The app context config only has a few (like 10 objects), 
yet it takes sometimes up to 20 seconds to load the container. 
I can see in the debugger this time appears to be attributed to loading lots of (DDLs?) with odd names.
The end result is the Windows Service takes to long to start and the IT operators think it's hung.  

What can I do to avoid this. I've tried "Just My Code". Any ideas?

    'Forge.Enterprise.Infrastructure.Scheduling.Server.vshost.exe' (Managed (v4.0.30319)): Loaded '0xclmvcv'
